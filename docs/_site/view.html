## Abstract

**BACKGROUND**\
The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program has made available online a
large number of public-use files from its predecessor, the World Fertility 
Survey (WFS) program, see [wfs.dhsprogram.com](http://wfs.dhsprogram.com).

**CONTRIBUTION**\
To encourage and facilitate the use of this data, we provide a Stata command
that can be used to extract and reshape the data, using local copies or
working directly with the DHS data archive pages. 

## 1. Introduction

The World Fertility Survey (WFS) program, the forerunner to the Demographic and 
Health Surveys (DHS) program, was a groundbreaking demographic data collection 
effort that conducted over 40 surveys between 1972 and 1984. To ensure that 
WFS’s valuable datasets continue to be available to the research community, 
the DHS program has published a large number of public-use data files through 
its data archive. Please visit [wfs.dhsprogram.com](http://wfs.dhsprogram.com)
for a list of the surveys available. 

This paper introduces a Stata command that facilitates access to WFS data, with 
a user-friendly syntax that allows one to view the documentation, extract a set 
of variables from a survey, reshape the union or birth histories from wide to 
long format or vice versa, and make local copies of the data and dictionary 
files, although users also have the option of working directly from the DHS 
data archive. 

A pioneering feature of the WFS program was its use of machine-readable data 
dictionaries to document the data files. This allows our command to read the 
dictionaries  as well as the data and to produce self-documented fully labeled 
Stata datasets. 

By automating WFS data extraction, our command is a substantial time saver, 
but  this does not exempt users from familiarizing themselves with the studies, 
recognizing that there are variations in survey design, questionnaire contents, 
and recoding of variables, that should inform the analysis of the data. 

## 2. The `wfs` command

To install the command from net-aware Stata, type 

  `net from http://wfs.dhsprogram.com` 
	
and click on the `wfs` link, or simply type 

  `net install wfs, from(http://wfs.dhsprogram.com)`
	
This will install the command and its help file.

The syntax of the command has five variants that address increasing
functionality, from viewing to data extraction to reshaping the histories
as well as making local copies of files.
For ease of reference we provide below a syntax diagram and a brief description 
of each variant, followed by a more detailed explanation including examples in 
sections 3 to 7. In describing the syntax we follow Stata conventions, using 
a `roman` font for keywords, *`italics`* for user-specified elements, square 
brackets for options, and  <code><u>underline</u></code> for minimal abbreviations. 

1. `wfs` \
  will open the home page of the WFS section of the DHS
  data archive using your default web browser. From there you can navigate 
  to the country pages, as discussed in section 3. 
  
2. <code>wfs using <i>filename</i> [, dhs]</code> \
  will open the data dictionary for a given dataset using Stata’s viewer, 
  examples follow in section 4. The file name or dataset name should not 
  include an extension. The `dhs` option reads the data dictionary from the 
  DHS archive; otherwise it assumes you have a local copy. 

3. <code>wfs <i>varlist</i> using <i>filename</i> [, dhs clear]</code> \
  will extract a set of variables from the specified dataset. The varlist 
  follows Stata conventions, as explained in more detail in section 5 below. 
  The `dhs` option is the same as syntax 2. The `clear` option overwrites the 
  dataset in memory, if any. 
  
4. `wfs reshape long|wide [, births|unions nodrop]` \
  will reshape the WFS data in memory from wide to long format or vice versa 
  using the birth or union histories, as further explained in section 6 below.
 
5. <code>wfs copy <i>filename</i> [, <u>dir</u>ectory(<i>folder</i>) replace]</code> \
  will make a local copy of the data and dictionary for a given dataset, saving 
  it in the specified folder or the current working directory. The `replace` 
  option will overwrite existing files. Examples follow in section 7 below.
  
## 3. Viewing surveys

When you visit the WFS section of the DHS data archive, you will see links to 
43 surveys from 42 countries. (The Dominican Republic had WFS surveys in 1975 
and 1980.) If you click on the link for a country and year, you will see a 
description of the survey. For example, the page for Colombia, 1976, is at 
[wfs.dhsprogram.com/index.cfm?ccode=co](http://wfs.dhsprogram.com/index.cfm?ccode=co). 

The country pages always include a table listing all public-use files. 
These files are  available in two different formats: WFS, a plain text ASCII 
format, and ISSA, a binary  format that requires the ISSA (Integrated System for 
Survey Analysis) program, an old DOS application that is no longer available. 
Our command works with files in WFS format. 

You will find individual standard recode data and dictionary files, such as 
`cosr02.dat` and `cosr02.dct` for Colombia. You will also find household data 
and dictionaries, such as `vehh02.dat` and `vehh02.dct` for Venezuela, as well 
as  household member data and dictionaries, such as `bdhm01.dat` and 
`bdhm01.dct` for Bangladesh. Many countries also have supplemental standard 
files with additional variables, such as `myss02.dat` and `myss02.dct` for 
Malaysia, and some have community data files, such a `egcd04.dat` and 
`egcd04.dct` for Egypt. The files are named  following the scheme `ccftvn`, 
where `cc` is a country code, `ft` is a file type, and `vn` is  a version number, 
with extensions `.dct` for the dictionary and `.dat` for the data. 
These  are the files we can work with. 

## 4. Viewing dictionaries

To view a data dictionary, you use the syntax

  <code>wfs using <i>filename</i> [, dhs]</code>

where the filename omits the dictionary extension.  For example, 
`wfs using cosr02, dhs` will show the machine-readable dictionary for the 
Colombia Standard Recode as stored in the WFS section of the DHS data archive.

Variables are typically grouped in sections. The individual standard
recode files, for example, include sampling information and key dates, 
a union history, nuptiality variables, a birth history, fertility
variables, breastfeeding, exposure status, fertility preferences,
knowledge and use of contraception, background characteristics of
the woman and the husband, and interview data. 

The woman-level variables have names starting with `V` and a three-digit
number, with the hundreds representing the content group. For example,
all background variables have numbers in the 700s, and `V702` is 
'Type of place of residence'.

The union histories include data for up to eight unions per woman and 
have names starting with `M`, followed by a two-digit union number and 
a third digit for the variable itself. For example, `M012` is the date of 
the first union and `M022` the date of the second union. 

Birth histories include data for up to 24 births per woman using a similar 
naming scheme starting with `B`, so `B012` is the date of the first birth 
and `B242` the date of the 24th birth. 

Some surveys also describe the union and birth histories using a 
compact table style with its own names. For example, `BDAT` refers to
the dates of birth in `B012` to `B242`, in addition to the detailed 
list. Our command, however, uses the individual variable names.

Specific surveys may include additional standard recode variables,
which have names starting with `X`, as well as country-specific variables,
with names that start with `S`. For example Colombia includes 
`X701`, 'Always lived in this locality', and 
`S107`, 'Marital status &lt;5 groups&gt;'. 

All variables have labels, and most also have value labels. For
example, `V702`, 'Type of place of residence', is coded 1 for 'Urban',
2 for 'Rural' and 99 for 'Not stated'.

The dictionaries also specify the code used for 'not applicable',
usually a string of 8s, and special codes, which are all codes
in excess of a specified value, often a string of 9s used for 'not stated'.
For example, `V702` defines `99` as a special code, and the value label 
tells us that it means 'Not stated'.  Variable `V301` is
breastfeeding in the open birth interval and defines all codes above
`96` as  special; the value labels tell us `96` is 'Still breastfeeding',
`98` is 'Did not breastfeed' and 99 is 'Not stated'.

For more detailed documentation on these data files, please refer to 
the WFS *Data Processing Guidelines*(WFS Central Staff 1980).


## 5. Extracting data

Once you have selected the variables you are interested in, the next step
is to extract them, which you do using the syntax

  <code>wfs <i>varlist</i> using <i>filename</i> [, dhs]</code>

The `varlist` is simply a list of the variables you want to extract.
Here we follow Stata conventions and refer to all variables using
lowercase names, even though they have uppercase names in the dictionary.
If you wanted age and type of place of residence from the Colombian
Standard Recode file, for example, you would type the command
`wfs v010 v702 using cosr02, dhs`. 

The variable list may also use 

* a hyphen to refer to consecutive variables in the dictionary. 
For example, you may refer to `v701-v705` to get the five residence and 
education variables.

* wildcards `*` and `?` with the same meaning as in Stata, so
`v7*` will extract all variables in section 7 and `m??2` will
extract the date of union for all unions.

* `births` to refer to all variables in the birth history, 
`unions` to refer to all variables in the union history, and
`all` to extract all variables in the dictionary.

These three conventions may be freely combined in a list; for example,
`v010 births m??2 v701-v705` is a valid list of variables. Note, however,
that wildcards may not be used to specify the beginning or end of a range,
just as in Stata. And of course `all` only makes sense by itself.

We extract variable and value labels for all selected variables. 
We also recode 'not applicable' values using Stata's `.n` missing value. 
We do not recode special codes,  because we think it is better for users 
to make their own decisions on how to handle these values.

To extract age at interview and age at first union in the Colombian 
survey and then tabulate age at interview, all we need is

	wfs v011 v110 using cosr02, dhs clear
	tab v011
	
If we tabulate age at first marriage, Stata will exclude single women
because they have been coded 'not applicable':

	tab v110
	
You could include single women in the table by adding the `missing` option
(abbreviated `m`) of the Stata `tab` command, which then becomes
`tab v110, missing`.

## 6. Reshaping the histories

The union histories are stored in wide format, with one record per woman. 
For some purposes the analyst may need the data in long format, with one
record per union. This can be done with the 
`wfs reshape long, unions` command, provided of course one has extracted
the union histories. Here's an example:

	wfs v010 unions using cosr02, dhs clear
	wfs reshape long, unions
	
Our command uses Stata's own `reshape` command to do the bulk of the work.
The Colombia dataset, which included 5,378 women, now has data for 3,868 unions.
We can tabulate the type of union

	tab m1
	
As you can see, the wide variables `m011` to `m081`, which have type of union
for unions 1 to 8, are now simply `m1`,
and the variable and value labels have adapted to the reshape, so `m1` is
'Type of union &lt;1-7&gt;'.  We also have a new variable, `union`, to record
the union number.

We could use `wfs reshape wide, unions` to go back to a wide format with one 
record per woman, but of course we would then have only ever married women
in the dataset, unless you specified `nodrop`, as explained below.

Everything said so far applies to the birth histories as well. If we
extract all births, we can reshape the data to obtain one record per birth:

	wfs v010 births using cosr02, dhs clear
	wfs reshape long, births
	
The standard output from Stata’s reshape shows that each birth variable had up 
to 24 instances, so we went from 5,378 women to 129,072 observations (5,378 × 
24), before dropping the padding to end with 14,432 births. 

The variables `b015` to `b245` containing the date of death (or not applicable) 
for each child have now become `b5`. We can tabulate age at death using 

	tab b5
	
to exclude surviving children, or `tab b5, missing` to include them.
In both cases children who died but whose age at death is missing
are included in the 'Not stated' category. Recall that we code
'not applicable' as missing `.n` but leave 'not stated' for you to 
handle.

The birth history may be reshaped back to wide format, but then the
dataset would include only mothers, unless `nodrop` was specified.
At that point one can freely go from wide to long and back to wide format 
as often as desired.

As noted above, when we reshape into long format, by default we keep 
only entries in the union or birth history that contain data, dropping 
empty entries which are coded 'not applicable' on all fields.
The option `nodrop` can be used with `reshape long` to keep all of the
entries; just type `wfs reshape long, births nodrop`.
If you then reshape back to wide format, you will have all the
original entries, including empty ones added for padding.

## 7. Local copies

A nice feature of the `wfs` command is that it can work directly from the
DHS data archive. If you are planning to extract several subsets of variables,
however, it probably pays to download the data and dictionary files to your 
local computer, which you can do using the syntax

  <code>wfs copy using <i>filename</i>[, <u>dir</u>ectory(<i>folder</i>) replace]</code>

By default, the data and dictionary files are copied to the current working 
directory, but the <code><u>dir</u>ectory(<i>folder</i>)</code> option may be used to 
provide an alternative destination, provided the target directory already exists.
The `replace` option may be used as usual to overwrite existing data and
dictionary files. 
For example, to copy the data and dictionary for the Colombian Standard Recode 
file to the current working directory, you would type 
the command `wfs copy using cosr02, replace`.
You would then be able to extract and reshape the data using these local copies
instead of the `dhs` option.

## 8. How it works

The `wfs` command works by reading the dictionary file or downloading it if
the `dhs` option was specified, so it can obtain information about all the 
variables you wish to extract.
It then writes a Stata script using `infix dictionary` and runs it
to read the data, which is downloaded by Stata if the `dhs` option
is in effect and otherwise read from the local file system. 
The next step is to label the variables, create value labels, and handle 
any 'not applicable' codes via recodes. 

The `wfs reshape` command uses Stata's `reshape` to do most of the
work, generating the appropriate command, but then modifies variable 
and value labels to adapt to the change in the unit of analysis. 
The command works only if the complete union or birth histories 
have been downloaded.
