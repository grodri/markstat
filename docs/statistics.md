Statistics and Population
-------------------------

My website at <https://grodri.github.io> has the computing logs for four courses I taught
at Princeton University: Generalized Linear Models, Multilevel Models, Survival Analysis
and Demographic Methods. The source code used to generate these computing logs is stored
in GitHub at <https://github.com/grodri/websrc>. 

The Generalized Linear Models (GLM) course has separate computing logs using Stata and R. 
The Stata logs were all done using `markstat`, while the R logs were produced using `rmarkdown`.
The links below will take you to the opening page of the computing logs, which has a button
to view the table of contents. Each of the 27 logs has a link to the source code repository
in GitHub. There you will find the `markstat` files with extension `.stmd`, and the equivalent
`rmarkdown` files with extension `.Rmd`.

- [GLMS R Logs](https://grodri.github.io/glms/stata)

The other three courses have combined computing logs that use tabs to choose between Stata
and R versions of the code, and were written using `markstat`, much in the same way as the
example on [Stata and R tabs](stata-r-tabs). The links below will take you to the
home page of each course, which has a button to view a list of computing logs. Each of the 62 
logs has a link to the appropriate section of the source code repository, where you will 
find the `markstat` files with extension `.stmd`, including both Stata and R code. The files
have a line with the code `.include srtabs` to include Bootstrap and code to switch tabs.
This code is also in the repository.

- [Demographic Methods](https://grodri.github.io/demography)

The repository also has the source code and supporting files for my Stata and R tutorials:

- [Stata Tutorial](https://grodri.github.io/stata)
- [Introducing R](https://grodri.github.io/R)

The home page for each tutorial has a link to the code repository. The Stata tutorial is written 
with `markstat` and the code is in files with extension `.stmd`. The R tutorial is written
with `rmarkdown` and the code is in files with extension `.Rmd`. In both cases a few additional 
files needed to reproduce the tutorials are included. More information on the source code for
the Stata tutorial is [available here](tutorial).
